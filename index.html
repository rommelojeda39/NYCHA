          <p> Like most Americans, Thanksgiving Day was one of the holidays Delia Barrios, 37, looked forward to. She would usually embellish her home with decorations and ornaments illustrative of the fall season. She would buy new plates, table
            tops, food and various types of drinks. For 20 years, ever since her arrival to the states from her native town in Guatemala, her routine to prepare the banquet for the holiday was the same— she prepared the turkey the night before,
            bathing it with achiote, stuffing it, adding herbs and other condiments, so that she could get up the next day before sunrise to put it in the oven. Later, she would cook rice, beans, and make a salad. It was a mix of the food she grew up
            with as a kid, and the American culture.Barrios said that she always waited for this day with excitement; it was one of the days of the year where she could get together with family and friends.
            <br><br>
            In a year filled with the anxieties of the COVID19 pandemic, Barrios knew the holiday season would be normal, but she never thought that it would be different because she would not have gas for more than two months. For that reason she
            did not plan anything for the holiday, she knew that planning a big meal without gas and a stove would be useless.
            <br><br>
            Her friends invited her to celebrate the day at their house, but given the ongoing pandemic she decided to stay at home. She said volunteers of many organizations brought food to the residents of the building, they gave her a cooked
            turkey, olive oil, stuffing, rice and potatoes. It was warm meals ready for the family, something which she did not expect. “It was something incredible how wonderful and helpful the people have been during these rough times,” Barrios
            Said.

          Barrios rents an apartment with her husband, and her three kids in the building 1-04 Astoria boulevard, one of the developments of NYCHA— New York City’s Housing Assistance. It is one of the 22 developments in Queens, that houses 2,923
          tenants. Since September 23rd the building has been without gas, leaving 48 apartments without any cooking gas during the middle of the second wave of the pandemic.
          <br><br>
          “Sometimes I would get bored at how fast I cooked before,” said Barrios regarding the difficulty that derived from the lack of gas to cook. It took her between 30mins to 1 hour to prepare breakfast for her kids, but now, she says, that it
          takes her more than two hours because she only has a hot plate to cook with. “As soon as I finish making breakfast, I have to start planning lunch because that takes so much time. Sometimes we buy food outside, which has doubled our
          expenses for groceries.”
          <br><br>
          Organizations like Astoria Mutual Aid, OANA, and others, have given help to the tenants of the building by bringing them hot meals and other essentials. Evie Hantzopoulos, candidate D-22, has been one of the most involved in bringing them
          support. “It’s a shame that our neighbors are going through inhumane circumstances,” she said during a rally that took place at Rally park in Astoria on Nov. 21st. Hantzopoulos, along with other volunteers, offered homemade breakfast to the
          tenants that same morning.

          Vanessa Jones Hall, a tenant of the building and member of Queen’s Community Board 1, said during the rally that “we have to be treated like human being. There is no reason that we should be treated the way we are treated now… we pay rent
          on time… but even then, money does not have anything to do with us having to be treated daily. We are human beings!”

          Poet and tenant of 1-04 Astoria, Shawnta “L.A. Paparazzi” Alston, used her poetry to share the resilience of her mother. She added that they are nt at the Rally to bash NYCHA, but to call for their action.

          In an email correspondence, the deputy press secretary for NYCHA’s department of communications, Rochel Leah Goldblatt said that “Restoring gas for private or public housing is a lengthy, multi-pronged process that involves numerous steps,
          including shutting off the gas, visiting the units for a scope of the work needed, making necessary repairs, investigating for asbestos, getting permit and inspection approval from our city partners and then coordinating with the utility
          company to safely turn the gas back on.”
          <br><br>
          Although it is unclear when the gas would be restored, Goldblatt added that the vendor will start the gas riser installation at 1-04 Astoria Boulevard the week of December 1st. As of the date of this publication, there are 58 NYCHA
          locations without gas— some have outages on certain lines, while others have outages on the entire building.
          <br><br>
          In order to help the tenants, NYCHA has distributed hot plates to each family and also coordinated with Urban Upbound, a non-profit organization, along with other city agencies, to bring food to the residents.
          <br><br>
          But the lack of clarity is not something new, says Barrios. She remembers that in multiple occasions, whenever she needed something fixed, NYCHA always took too long and never met their obligations. During the cold winters, for example,
          Barrios explains that heating used to go off at random times. This was so often that she had to buy her own portable heater to keep her home warm.

        <h3> 58 REPORTED GAS OUTAGES </h3>
        <div>
          <p> As of December 9th, there are 58 outages in the NYCHA's Developments. While this number is high, it does not tell the full story. To put it into perspective, when the entire building 1-04 Astoria Blvd. did not have gas, 46 apartments
            were affected. So
            it's unclear how many people are without gas or other utilities at the moment.

            website does not divulge the number of tenants per each affected building, nor does it tell the number of units affacted by each line that is out.

          <h3> Support from Representatives and NYCHA's Response </h3>

          <div>
            <p>
              Carolyn Maloney, from the house of representatives, and senator Michael Gianaris, D-12, attended the rally at Radial Park to show their support for the tenants of 1-04 Astoria Blvd. Respectively, each of their offices wrote letter
              demanding more funding more funding for NYCHA.
              <br>
              <br>
              However, it will take some time and money said Goldblatt. “Astoria Houses is nearly 70 years old and all of the piping is past its expected useful life of 65 years. It will cost approximately $8.3 million to replace the gas risers at
              this development… After that process is completed, the Department of Buildings will conduct the final inspections needed to safely ensure restoration,” she said.
              <br>
              <br>
              In the mean time, Ashely Barrios, 11, Barrio’s daughter, said that to be in this situation was like a constant reminder of her economic. “I know that I am poor, but there is no need to be reminded every day like this,” Ashley said.
